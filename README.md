## Monkeying around with TensorFlow Java 2.3 from Scala

There is a new version of [TensorFlow Java](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_java) that installs easily.

## Status Starter Project for TensorFlow on Scala

Currently this project is the TensorFlow Java hello world project but setup in Scala. 
One purpose is to check how well TesnforFlow works with Scala on different platforms. 

So far the results has been good: This installs cleanly on Linux, macOS and Windows.

Might also test out prebuild models for TensorFlow on different platfomrs.
